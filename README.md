Decoding A Message  C++ Program Learned from the book "Think Like A Programmer Code" by V Anton

This Program gets an arbitrary size input. The input must be a number then followed by a comma. ex: (number,number,...,number) 
Reads the Users input as a character converted into an integer.
1) Starting off with UPPERCASE mode: reads the user input then mod by 27. The remainder whole number is the location of the Letter in an Alphabetical sequence.
2) The three modes (UPPERCASE, LOWERCASE, PUNCUATION) are switch when mod = 0.
3) LOWERCASE is similar to UPPERCASE, however it contains lowercase letters.
4) The Punctuation mode is moded by 9.
